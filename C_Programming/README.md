# C-programs
Programming in C files

This is collection of programs I did work during my B.tech. It includes programs related to different chapters like Data Structure, String, Patterns, etc.
It also includes some of interesting games developed in C.
Porgrams doesn't have any comments as this is my initial work when I had no idea importance of comments. Will add comments as soon as possible. 
If you have any issues, reach out to my mail.

Thanks
